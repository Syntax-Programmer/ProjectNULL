You are the only zombie in the world. But you are self aware you are a zombie. So you work on finding a cure for yourself.

To stay alive you must hunt ppl but that will make your efforts to find cure difficult as ppl will begin attacking you.



The zombie will look like humans, but as you eat they become suspicious of you. So you have to cleverly trap ppl to eat them out of sight of ppl.

You must behave normally to reduce your suspicion meter. 

Not eating for a long time will cause you to decay.

You must go on to skillfully kill 3 officers to get cure fragments. Which will cure you.
These ppl were the direct cause for you to become like this.

high suspicion meter will make ppl kill you.





Suspicion Meter
Global float value (0.0 to 100.0)

Increased by:
Being seen feeding
Acting oddly (e.g., sprinting, erratic movement)

Decreased by:
Blending in (walking near crowds)
Performing “normal” actions (idle, slow walk)


AI Behavior
Civilians: Randomly wander, flee when they see something suspicious
Officers: Patrol in a set area; will chase if they detect you
Witness System: If a civilian sees a feeding → raises local alarm

I want to since the models are not images but nested rects meant to simulate faces, I have room to play around with algorithmically generated emotions by modifying the shapes of the rects
